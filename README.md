# Automatic-Pet-Feeder 


This project is an automatic feeder designed to facilitate the feeding and care of pets such as dogs and cats. It combines hardware (Arduino, sensors, actuators and a bluetooth module) with an Android mobile application developed with Android Studio to automate and customize the feeding, as well as monitor in real time and provide statistics.

## üíª Software
- Arduino C++: Code to control sensors and actuators, and manage Bluetooth connectivity.
- Android mobile application: Developed in Java with Android Studio, to control and monitor the feeder.
- Firebase: Pet data storage and real-time statistics.

### Data transfer v√≠a Bluetooth:
String message types:
- Sent by the android application:
  - ‚Äúw‚Äù: add extra water
  - f": add extra food
  - ‚Äúc, dailyfood, dailywater, autorefill‚Äù: indicates the daily target for each animal and if the autorefill option is enabled.
- Sent by arduino:
  - water_sensor: current amount of water
  - food_sensor: current amount of food 
  - dailyfoodcompleted: if the daily food goal has been reached
  - dailywatercompleted: if the daily water goal has been reached
